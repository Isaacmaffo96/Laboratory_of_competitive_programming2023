# Laboratory of competitive programming 2023
Python code of the competitive programming course

The goal of the course is to study and learn how to solve algorithmic problems typically found in coding competitions. The focus is mainly on understanding how to use fundamental algorithms, data structures, and common approaches (or patterns) to produce solutions with low computational complexity.
