"""This lesson gives an introduction to binary trees. We are going to
learn how to insert and search keys, visit the tree in different ways
(in-order, pre-order, post-order), compute the height of the tree,
test whether the tree is full, how to "reverse" the tree, and finally
how to lookup the lowest common ancestor for two nodes.

However, the some of the following methods have TWO major PROBLEMS:

1) insert leaves the tree unbalanced, hence it may collapse into a
list

2) several functions use recursion, this isn't a safe approach

In the next lesson we are going to implement a better version of the
binary tree. In the meanwhile, why don't you try to improve the
implementation as home practice?

There are also a couple of additional exercises in the comments.

===

P.S. in this lesson we also start talking about decorators!
